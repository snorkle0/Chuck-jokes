# Welcome to Random Chuck Norris React App!

Whenever you feel down Chuck is there to help!
Basic purpose of this app is to generate random Chuck Norris jokes.
You can impersonate the joke with yourself or someone else.
Jokes are categorized and you are able to limit random jokes to be generated only from one specific category (e.g. 'explicit') to spicy up the joke even further.


## General usage

When the website is loaded you will be presented with a randomly generated joke.
To customize generated jokes use 'Categories' dropdown by selecting one of available categories. To personalize the joke use text field 'Impersonate Chuck Norris' and type in full name of a person.

If you like a certain joke you can save it by clicking the '+' button below.
If you added a joke by mistake you can remove it by using the '-' button.

Between those two buttons you see a counter of how many jokes are currently saved.

If you want to keep the jokes on your local drive click the "Save Jokes" button to download a .txt file with your saved jokes.
